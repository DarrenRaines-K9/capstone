# Meal Prep

Meal Prep is an application based meal prep ordering service

# Purpose 

In order to make ordering and employee management easier for our client, They requested an application to facilitate the following components. 

`Login`
`Register`
`Welcome`
`EmployeeList`
`EmployeeDetails`
`OrderList`
`OrderDetails`
`NewOrder`
`OrderForm`
`SalesReport`
`ApplicationViews`

By implementing the above components the Client will now be able to manage `EmployeeList` and `OrderList` through editing the details of a specific order or employee, as well as deleting that employee or order. Also the client will be able to create a `NewOrder` while adding a new customer object to the database simultaneously, creating new customer related data as well as user/admin related data associated with that order. `SalesReport will be implemented in v2.0 `
